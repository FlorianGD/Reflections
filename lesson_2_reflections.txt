What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git file is created.
But no commit is made automatically.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate status between the working directory and the repository. It allows us to make commit to the files that we want to, and not necessarily to everything at once.
